    <p>
      The Windham Technical High School Parent Faculty Organization holds
      meetings in the school cafeteria on the first Wednesday of each month at 6
      p.m. Parents, guardians, friends and faculty are invited and encouraged to
      attend.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to providing a venue for parents/guardians and faculty to
      communicate with each other, meetings are set-up to allow for open
      discussion of ideas, faculty presentations and voting on how to distribute
      PFO funds so that we maximize the positive impact to students.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another primary goal of the PFO is to raise funds for student scholarships
      and other student- or sports-based organizations. This is achieved through
      various fundraising events throughout the year. We also sell Windham Tech
      Wear and concessions, have spaghetti dinners and are always accepting
      donations. There are a variety of ways to help support our school and the
      PFO! And we are always looking for new fundraising ideas and
      opportunities!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is never too late to join and show your support! We look forward to new
      faces and new ideas!
